# Supreme Chi-Town Coding Crew Manifesto

We are a small group of aspiring web developers and journalists based in Chicago who meet regularly to learn basic web skills and work on data journalism and civic technology projects.

Fluency with the web and information technology is a critical, marketable job skill. We teach each other practical tech skills that help us advance professionally.

Technology projects are about more than engineering. We welcome anyone who meets basic requirements and wants to learn. We work on projects that benefit from a wide variety of skills.

Learning to make web sites and applications requires access to some basic resources. We steer new participants without these resources to places and programs where they can get a free or cheap laptop, learn basic computer literacy, and obtain adequate Internet access.

Asking questions about issues, systems, and institutions that affect our community is civic engagement. We explore the world with code, research, design, and storytelling. 

Learning to code is learning to communicate. We emphasize fundamentals like task management, troubleshooting, and version control.

Citizens don't have enough agency over the systems that govern our lives. We use data journalism to learn about and interrogate those systems to gain understanding and create accountability. 

Many real world processes have multiple, intertwined data collection and management steps. We research, map out, and describe complex systems.

Open data only tells part of the story. We seek to liberate data from obscure sources, legacy systems and using public disclosure requests. We analyze and summarize data to make it more useful. We republish data on the web using standard, open formats.

Everyone benefits from transparency. We share our work by publishing our projects with open source licensed code and Creative Commons licensed content. 

The demographics of the technology industry does not represent society, which makes it that much harder to create technology that is responsible and humane. We organize for diversity by recruiting outside of the mainstream tech industry and through a gender-equal leadership policy.

Consistent face-to-face interaction is the best way to collaborate and encourage long term learning. We meet regularly in accessible locations.

Misconduct and harassment are ever-present threats to a community's integrity. We work to prevent harassment before it happens by maintaining a safe space and responding to incidents in accordance with the [FreeGeek Chicago Code of Conduct](https://github.com/freegeekchicago/fgc-docs/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

Self-determination builds community and provides an antidote to atrophied civic and political life. We use participatory, consensus-based governance to practice democracy.

Learning software development is an overwhelmingly popular subject. We aim to keep our group small while hatching new projects and working with similar groups around the world.
