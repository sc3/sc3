# What is Supreme Chi-Town Coding Crew?

Supreme Chi-Town Coding Crew is a loose team of volunteers that educate Chicagoans in practical, professional development software development skills by collaboratively developing useful web applications.

# How do I join?

Come to OpenHack at FreeGeek Chicago, every Saturday from 1pm-5pm at 3411 W. Diversey. Details available on the [FreeGeek Chicago calendar](http://freegeekchicago.org/calendar).

# Our goals

* We will be as diverse as Chicago. 
* We will welcome everyone, whatever their skill level.
* We will do outreach to people outside the mainstream IT industry and recruit contributors who are routinely under-valued because of economic, racial, gender, and generational bias.
* We will prioritize and teach practical web development skills and fundamentals using popular, widely used tools, platforms, and standards.
* We will use loose consensus in face-to-face meetings to make decisions.
* We will release our software under free software licenses.
* We will build open web APIs when our software uses and processes data.
* We will build web applications that investigate and interrogate Chicago and beyond.
* We will strive to connect contributors to good professional opportunities, especially stable, well-paid contracts and jobs.
* We will create user-friendly software.
* We will have a blast.

# Governance

Decisions such as what projects we'll tackle and licenses we'll use loose consensus in face to face meetings will be handled with loose consensus. Anyone may raise an issue for consideration at a meeting or on the Github issue tracker. Participants may:

* Join in on the proposal.
* Stand aside and let someone else do it.
* Object and ask for further consideration. 

If there is an objection, *everyone* participating must come to an agreement about how to proceed or the proposal will be shelved.

# Copyright

The FreeGeek Chicago community and all contributors will share the copyright to SC3 intellectual property on a per-project basis.

# Evolving model

Like FreeGeek Chicago early on, we'll use the consensus process to refine and improve this document.
